# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A simulation of how the CPU uses 4 different algorithms to schedule processes. 
First Come First Serve, Round Robin, Shortest Remaining Time First, and Preemptive Priority with Aging. 

## Usage

To use it, when running the file, make sure to specify which algorithm you want to simulate, like so.

./scheduler [FCFS/RR/SRTF/PPA] [Optional quantum or Increaser]
If using Round Robin, you need to also specify a quantum value.
If using Preemptive Priority, you need to specify an increaser value, which is what the priorities will increase by every 5 ticks.
