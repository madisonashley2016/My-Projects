# My Projects
These are some small projects and bits of code that I have worked on or explored.
I am planning on using this as a way to categorize, save, and share everything that I work on.
I will continuously be updating this repository. 

Disclaimer: All code that I upload here is meant to be an easy way to share my portfolio, and what I have been working on, and is not intended for any person to use or copy. Thank you.
