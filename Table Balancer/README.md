# Table Balancer

Takes a square table of variable size specified by the user, and an equal number of weights, with weights corresponding to their place in the table, and places them on the table, so that the table remains balanced on a point, according to the constraints set.

## Usage

python tablebalancer.py
Then it will prompt you for the size of the table. Just type one int number, as tables can only be square in this scenario.
